## ABOUT ##
These Linux system scripts call a Zotero picker and enter a citation marker into your document.  
Scrips are available in two citation marker formats: Pandoc and Scannable Cite.  

## REQUIREMENTS ##
Zotero plugin required: Better BibTeX  
Packages required: xdotool and libnotify-bin  

## INSTALLATION ##
Copy the script you need to $HOME/bin or elsewhere in your PATH  
Open the file permissions (under properties) and set it to be executable  
The default text editor is set to Scrivener. Edit Preferences in the script if you use a different program.  
Create a system-wide keyboard shortcut (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Z) for your script.  

## HELP ##
To insert a Zotero citation marker into your document, use your keyboard shortcut.  
The Zotero picker should appear; use it as normal and the citation should appear in your text editor.  
The citation marker appears in your chosen format.  
See the Zotero RTF/ODF plugin webpage for more information on Scannable Cite.
